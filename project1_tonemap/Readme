1. Tested Enviroment:
	Mac OS X 10.11.3

2. Language:
	C++11, Matlab

3. Library dependency:
	Opencv 3.1.0
	pkg-config (optional)

4. Original photos:
	library directory (with a list.txt to record exposure time)

5. HDR image:
	library/library.hdr

6. Tone-mapped image:
	library/library.jpg (tone-mapped by Matlab function)
	output/library.hdr.jpg (tone-mapped by self-implement tone-mapping function)

7. Report:
	vfx-project1.pdf

8. Instruction:
	You may use ``Makefile'' to make and run alignment and tone-mapping.
	1. ``make run_mtb'' for auto alignment on library photos. (./mtb library)
	2. Run hdr.m to generate the hdr file and Matlab tone-mapped jpg file.
	3. ``make run_tonemap'' for auto tone-mapping. (./tonemap library/library.hdr)
